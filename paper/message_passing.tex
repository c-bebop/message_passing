\begin{abstract}

Message passing in distributed systems is a model to exchange messages within a process pair by making use of several standards and implementation details. Those have been developed to offer the right message passing models for the different areas of applications. The programming language Erlang natively supports an asynchronous message passing model which makes the implementation of concurrent applications transparent to the software developer.

\section{\scshape{\textcolor{blue}{Message Oriented Communication}}} \label{introduction}

\subsection{\scshape{Introduction}}

Communication in distributed systems defines a distributed system itself: N systems execute one or more tasks by computing and communicating with each other. Every time systems shall communicate with each other to provide services, a proficient communication model has to be implemented. There are several models of communication in distributed systems such as \gls{rpc} or object method invocation \cite[chap. 4.3 / p. 203]{tanenbaum}. With this paper I'll introduce you to the message passing model in distributed systems.\\

\noindent As human beings we already have a deep understanding of different models of message passing. While you read these words, I am passing a message to you, which seems to be a trivial thing to people who can read. In more philosophical terms, now that you are reading those words, a message is being passed from one entity (me, the writer) to another entity (you, the reader) which is obviously non trivial considering all the assumptions we would have to make to actually realize this message passing model between human beings.\\

\noindent Message passing in distributed systems is based on messages, composed of bit strings, exchanged within a process pair which would be the equivalent to the entity pair. It is important to understand that message passing is a model designed for \gls{ipc}. Whether those processes are located on one or on two systems, is irrelevant to the provided functionality.\\

\subsection{\scshape{Requirements in Theory}}

\noindent The following items are the theoretical basic requirements for a system to provide the functionality of message passing:

\begin{itemize}

\item \textbf{Connectivity}: A connection to communicate has to be established between the process pair
\item \textbf{Ability}: Each process has to be able to receive or send messages
\item \textbf{Integrity}: Sent messages have to be delivered as is
\item \textbf{Intelligibility}: The receiving process has to be able to interpret the message as intended
\item \textbf{Executability}: The delivered message has to lead to an execution of the desired instructions

\end{itemize}

\subsection{\scshape{Requirements Provider in Practice}}

\noindent To provide the above mentioned requirements there several message passing models resulting in well defined standards and concrete implementations have been developed in the last decades. To facilitate understanding the relations between the theoretical requirements and a concrete implementation, I will choose the \gls{tcp} which uses several socket primitives as example \cite[chap 4.3.1 on p. 141 - 142]{tanenbaum}:

\begin{itemize}

\item \textbf{Connectivity}: \gls{tcp} provides the \textit{Socket} primitive to create that end point and also the \textit{Bind} primitive to bind a local address to that socket. The \textit{Connect} primitive then provides the functionality to establish a connection.

\item \textbf{Ability}: \gls{tcp} provides the two primitives \textit{Send} and \textit{Receive} to simply send and receive data via the connection.

\item \textbf{Integrity}: \gls{tcp} provides several mechanisms to ensure that there has been no data loss when sending or receiving messages. On the other hand this makes the protocol slower than other protocols such as the \gls{rtp} or the \gls{udp}.

\end{itemize}

\noindent The requirements of \textbf{Intelligibility} and \textbf{Executability} do not come under the area of responsibility of \gls{tcp} and thus other standards have to take place, such as \gls{xml} or \gls{json} to structure the messages in a standardized manner, and the message parsing implementation to call the desired instructions.\\

\noindent There are other socket primitives than the above mentioned to provide the functionality of \gls{tcp} \cite[ch. 4.3.1 on p. 141]{tanenbaum}. The referenced book \cite{tanenbaum} provides useful and valuable information on this topic.\\

\noindent It is also important to understand that this was just a round-up of how one can make basic use of the socket primitives to implement message passing in an application. There is plenty to discuss about how message passing is realized, such as the \gls{osi} which was developed by the \gls{iso} to model the different layers of network oriented communication \cite[ch. 4.1.1 on p. 116]{tanenbaum}. Furthermore, the \gls{os} has to reserve local memory to provide a buffer for the in- and outgoing messages.

\subsection{\scshape{Asynchronous vs. Synchronous Message Passing}}

\noindent After discussing a protocol to handle the socket primitives, it is necessary to consider one major difference in message passing models, which is whether to use asynchronous or synchronous message passing. Passing a message synchronously means that the called message send routine returns after the request has been successfully transmitted (or an error occurred). Receiving a message synchronously means that the called message receiving routine reads a specific amount of bytes from the socket and returns that message.\\

\noindent To pass or receive a message asynchronously, an additional application layer i.e. middleware is introduced. The call of a send routine can either return when the middleware took over the transmission of the request, or when it successfully sent the request to the receiver, or when it successfully sent the request to the receiver, assuring this by a corresponding message \cite[ch. 4.1 on p. 125]{tanenbaum}.\\

\noindent The middleware can also perform some preparatory work e.g. separating stand-alone request bit strings and parsing them into a data structure and returning it when calling the receive routine of the message passing middleware.\\

\noindent One key model to provide such middleware functionalities are message queues. A message queue is a queue to store messages by the \gls{fifo} principle. This enables the application to asynchronously send and receive messages by offering an incoming message queue and an outgoing message queue. This makes all the send and receive mechanisms fully transparent to the application \cite[ch. 4.3.2 on p. 145 - 147]{tanenbaum}.

\section{\scshape{\textcolor{blue}{Definition of Message Passing in Distributed Systems}}}

\begin{quote}
\textit{Message passing in distributed systems is a model to exchange messages within a process pair by making use of several standards and implementation details. The specifically used message passing model can diverge extremely in its provided functionality and defines how to provide the connection and send or receive messages whereas the physical conditions and the implementation of executing the desired instructions is undefined.}
\end{quote}

\section{\scshape{\textcolor{blue}{Message-Passing Interface Standard}}} \label{message_passing_interface}

To pass messages between processes is adding large overhead to the communication model. Nevertheless, providing a well defined interface to control exactly how messages are passed regains the ability to write \gls{hpc} applications.\\

\noindent The \gls{mpi} is a message-passing library interface specification, created for high performance and scalable distributed systems where high-efficiency is needed.  The \gls{mpi} standard was designed by the \gls{mpif} which is an open group with representatives from many organizations. The current version of the \gls{mpi} standard is MPI-3.0 \cite[ch. Abstract/ii \& Acknowledgements/xx \& 1.1 on p. 1]{mpi}.\\

\noindent The \gls{mpif} aims to offer a standard which establishes a practical, portable, efficient and flexible way of implementing message-passing in various high-level programming languages (e.g. C, C++, Fortran) \cite[ch. History/iii]{mpi}. Furthermore, the \gls{mpi} simplifies the communication primitives and brings them to an abstraction level to perfectly fit the programmer's needs of writing efficient and clean code for such \gls{hpc} distributed systems \cite[ch. 4.3.1 on p 143]{tanenbaum}.\\

\noindent \gls{tcp} does not fit those requirements. While the socket primitives \textit{read} and \textit{write} are sufficient for several general-purpose protocols (managing the communication across networks), they are insufficient for high-speed interconnection networks such as super computers or server clusters. The \gls{mpi} standard offers a set of functions and datatypes with which the software developer is able to explicitly execute synchronous and asynchronous message passing routines \cite[ch. 4.3 on p. 143]{tanenbaum}.

\section{\scshape{\textcolor{blue}{Message Passing in Erlang}}} \label{erlang}

\subsection{Introduction}

Erlang is a functional, declarative programming language that was written for the need of real-time, non-stop, concurrent, very large and distributed system applications \cite[chap. 1 / p. 1]{Armstrong96erlang}. While the language was originally designed by Joe Armstrong, Robert Virding and Mike Williams for Ericsson (a Swedish telecommunications provider) in 1986, it finally became open source in 1998, thanks to the open source initiatives lead by Linux \cite[chap. 8 on p. 39]{erl_history}.\\

\noindent Joe Armstrong, who started to design Erlang by adding functionality to Prolog, named it after the Danish mathematician Agner Krarup Erlang (creator of the Erlang loss formula) following the tradition of naming programming languages after dead mathematicians \cite[chap. 4.1 on p. 13]{erl_history}.\\

\noindent Erlang uses a native, asynchronous message passing model to communicate between light weight processes, also called actors \cite[chap. 1 on p. 1]{Armstrong96erlang}. Erlang does not make heavy use of the executing \gls{os} to provide the described concurrency model, which implicitly means that Erlang decouples the underlying \gls{os} and thus providing a cross-platform and transparent message passing model \cite[chap. 1  \& 3 on p. 1 - 3]{Armstrong96erlang}.

\subsection{Concurrency in Erlang}

\noindent Erlang provides semantics and built-in functions to parallelize  applications by message passing \cite[ch. 4.3 on p. 95 - 104]{erl_doc}:

\begin{itemize}

\item \textcolor{red}{spawn}(\textit{Module}, \textit{Exported Function}, \textit{List of Arguments})\\
Function which creates a new actor by running the \textit{Exported Function} with the \textit{List of Arguments} located in the \textit{Module} (a set of functions located in one file) and which returns the \gls{pid}, which uniquely identifies the created actor.\\

\item The \textcolor{red}{receive} construct allows the function executed by an actor to receive messages by using a message queue.

\item The \textcolor{red}{!} operator sends the right-handed term to the left handed \gls{pid}. The right-handed term is the sent message.

\item \textcolor{red}{self}() \\
Function returning the \gls{pid} of the actor executing the function.

\end{itemize}

\noindent Although the semantics and functions described above require foreknowledge on the Erlang programming language, it was important for me to show that Erlang is not only offering an easily intelligible interface for concurrency, it rather is a concurrent functional programming language. I recommend to take a look at the referenced official Erlang documentation or to \textit{learn you some Erlang} on \url{www.learnyousomeerlang.com}.

\subsection{Implementation of a Simple Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange in Erlang} \label{erlang_implementation}

The following implementation of a Diffie-Hellman key exchange algorithm in Erlang is simplified. Please note that this Erlang application is not in any way acceptable as an adequate implementation of the Diffie-Hellman key exchange algorithm for use in the field! The code demonstrates the simplicity of implementing concurrent applications in Erlang by using message passing. The sourcecode is hosted by Github:

\subsection{Running the Simple Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange in Erlang}

To run the applicatoin (\ref{erlang_implementation}) in a Linux shell one shall do the following (assuming that Erlang is already installed, help can be found at \url{http://www.erlang.org/doc/installation_guide/INSTALL.html}).

\subsubsection{Preparatory Work}

\noindent Open a Linux shell, go to the \textit{source} directory of the Erlang code and type:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
$ erl -sname bob
\end{lstlisting}

\noindent Which will output (meta data depends of the executing system):

\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
Erlang/OTP 17 [erts-6.3] [source] [64-bit] [smp:4:4] [async-threads:10] [hipe] [kernel-poll:false]

Eshell V6.3  (abort with ^G)
(bob@localhost)1> 
\end{lstlisting}

\noindent The option \textit{-sname bob} tells the Erlang shell to run on a node called \textit{bob}. First one shall compile the two modules and afterwards:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
(bob@localhost)1> c(diffie_hellman).
{ok,diffie_hellman}
(bob@localhost)2> c(my_math).
{ok,my_math}
\end{lstlisting}

\subsubsection{Running the Application on One Node}

Now execute the \textit{startExample} function as follows:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
(bob@localhost)3> diffie_hellman:startExample().
"Alice" (<0.50.0>): The shared private Key, exchanged with "Bob" is: 2
"Bob" (<0.51.0>): The shared private Key, exchanged with "Alice" is: 2
{<0.50.0>,<0.51.0>}
\end{lstlisting}

\noindent Executing the function \textit{startExample} spawns a process that executes the \textit{listenKeyExchange} function with \textit{15} as the \textit{private key} and \textit{"Alice"} as the name and binds the returning \gls{pid} to the value called Alice. Afterwards, \textit{startExample} spawns another process that executes the \textit{startKeyExchange} function with \textit{23} for \textit{P}, \textit{5} for \textit{G}, \textit{6} for the \textit{private key}, the \gls{pid} of Alice and \textit{"Bob"} as the name which binds the returning \gls{pid} to the value called Bob. At the end the function returns the two pids of \textit{Alice} and \textit{Bob}. As we can see from the output, Alice has the \gls{pid} <0.50.0> and the calculated private key, exchanged with Bob is 2. Bob has the \gls{pid} <0.51.0> and has computed the same private key.

\subsubsection{Running the Application on Two Nodes}

\noindent Now run the key exchange algorithm on two nodes. Open another shell, go to the \textit{source} directory of the Erlang code and type:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash, numbers=none]
$ erl -sname alice
\end{lstlisting}

\noindent Which will output (meta data depends of the executing system):

\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
Erlang/OTP 17 [erts-6.3] [source] [64-bit] [smp:4:4] [async-threads:10] [hipe] [kernel-poll:false]

Eshell V6.3  (abort with ^G)
(alice@localhost)1>
\end{lstlisting}

\noindent This means we're now running another Erlang shell on the node alice (compile both files in the new Erlang shell, too). Now in the Erlang shell running the node \textit{bob} execute the function \textit{startRemoteExample} with the atom \textit{alice@localhost} as the transferred parameter to specify on which node the actor shall be spawned that executes the \textit{listenKeyExchange} function:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash, numbers=none]
(bob@localhost)4> diffie_hellman:startRemoteExample(alice@localhost).
\end{lstlisting}

\noindent This will output the following:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash, numbers=none]
{<9879.54.0>,<0.58.0>}
"Alice" (<9879.54.0>): The shared private Key, exchanged with "Bob" is: 2
"Bob" (<0.58.0>): The shared private Key, exchanged with "Alice" is: 2
\end{lstlisting}

\noindent All transferred parameters are the same with the difference that the \textit{Alice} actor is now located on the node \textit{alice}. The output is still printed out in the \textit{bob} node, since the Erlang io system recognizes where the process is spawned from and sends all the output there \cite[ch. 4.3.4 on p. 104]{erl_doc}.\\
