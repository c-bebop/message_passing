This is a 'Introductory Guide to Message Passing in Distributed Computer Systems'.
I had to write this technical report for the course 'Distributed Systems' in my B.Sc. studies.

# Abstract
Message passing in distributed systems is a model to exchange messages within a process pair by making use of several standards and implementation details. Those have been developed to offer the right message passing models for the different areas of applications. The programming language Erlang natively supports an asynchronous message passing model which makes the implementation of concurrent applications transparent to the software developer.
